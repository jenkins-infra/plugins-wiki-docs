This plugin enable sorting the matrix configurationsNow there is 3 kinds
of sorting:

1\) Last axis order - sort by the order in which is axis added by user

2\) Estimation duration of build (longest first) - Determine estimation
duration of build by previous build and, the longer estimations go
before the shorter estimations.

3\) Estimation duration of build (shortest first) - Similar to longest
first, but there is reverse order (shortest fist)
