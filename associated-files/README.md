This plugin allows for marking files or directories outside of Jenkins
as related to a build.

This plugin allows you to specify a list of files and/or directories to
associate with a given build, in that job's configuration. This is to
associate files/directories outside of Jenkins which are still
produced/controlled/etc by the build in question with that build. They
will be reported alongside archived artifacts on the build page, and
will be deleted when the build itself is deleted.
