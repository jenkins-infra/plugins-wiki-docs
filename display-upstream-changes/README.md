# Summary

Displays all upstream changes on a build's summary page.

## Usage

Display Upstream Changes is a Publisher, and needs to be enabled on a
per-project basis in the Post-Build section of the job config. Once
enabled, all subsequent builds will show the changes from upstream jobs
on the build summary page (NOT the Recent Changes page!)
