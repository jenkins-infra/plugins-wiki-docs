This plugin allows you to mark a job a favorite.This is controlled via a
list view column you need to add to a view. You can then click on a star
to favorite or unfavorite a job. There is also a job filter to allow you
to create a view that only shows your favorites.

# Configuration

It is recommended you change your default view to either one you create,
or follow the directions in [Editing or Replacing the All
View](http://localhost:8085/display/JENKINS/Editing+or+Replacing+the+All+View)
to allow the Favorite column to show up. Once you have the Favorite
column, it will show a star that logged in users will be able to click
to make a favorite. You can also add another view, and apply the
"Favorites Filter" to show favorites only in that view.
