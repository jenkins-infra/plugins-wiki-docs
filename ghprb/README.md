# GitHub Pull Request Builder

This plugin builds GitHub pull requests and reports results.

## Deprecated

This plugin is **deprecated**. It has been replaced by the [GitHub Branch Source Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-branch-source/). It has known security vulnerabilities and is no longer being maintained. Users should migrate to the [GitHub Branch Source Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-branch-source/).

## Deprecated

More **up to date** information is available on the:  
[Github
README.md](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ghprb-plugin/blob/master/README.md)

**Commands:**Â 

When a new pull request is opened in the project and the author of the
pull request isn't white-listed, builder will ask "Can one of the admins
verify this patch?".

-   "ok to test" to accept this pull request for testing
-   "test this please" for a one time test run
-   "add to whitelist" to add the author to the whitelist

If the build fails for other various reasons you can rebuild.

-   "retest this please" to start a new build

**Installation:**

-   I recommend to create GitHub 'bot' user that will be used for
    communication with GitHub (however you can use your own account if
    you want).
-   The user needs to have push rights for your repository (must be
    collaborator (user repo) or must have Push & Pull rights
    (organization repo)).
-   If you want to use GitHub hooks have them set automatically the user
    needs to have administrator rights for your repository (must be
    owner (user repo) or must have Push, Pull & Administrative rights
    (organization repo))

&nbsp;

-   Install the plugin.
-   Go to \`\`Manage Jenkins\`\` -\> \`\`Configure System\`\` -\>
    \`\`GitHub pull requests builder\`\` section.

&nbsp;

-   Add GitHub usernames of admins (these usernames will be used as
    defaults in new jobs).
-   Under Advanced, you can modify:
    -   The phrase for adding users to the whitelist via comment. (Java
        regexp)
    -   The phrase for accepting a pull request for testing. (Java
        regexp)
    -   The phrase for starting a new build. (Java regexp)
    -   The crontab line. This specify default setting for new jobs.
-   Under Application Setup
    -   There are global and job default extensions that can be
        configured for things like:
        -   Commit status updates
        -   Build status messages
        -   Adding lines from the build log to the build result message
        -   etc.

#### Credentials

-   If you are using Enterprise GitHub set the server api URL in
    \`\`GitHub server api URL\`\`. Otherwise leave there
    \`\`[https://api.github.com](https://api.github.com/)\`\`.
-   A GitHub API token or username password can be used for access to
    the GitHub API
-   To setup credentials for a given GitHub Server API URL:
    -   Click Add next to the \`\`Credentials\`\` drop down
        -   For a token select \`\`Kind\`\` -\> \`\`Secret text\`\`
            -   If you haven't generated an access token you can
                generate one in \`\`Test Credentials...\`\`.
                -   Set your 'bot' user's GitHub username and password.
                -   Press the \`\`Create Access Token\`\` button
                -   Jenkins will create a token credential, and give you
                    the id of the newly created credentials. The default
                    description is: \`\`serverAPIUrl + " GitHub auto
                    generated token credentials"\`\`.
        -   For username/password us \`\`Kind\`\` -\> \`\`Username with
            password\`\`
            -   The scope determines what has access to the credentials
                you are about to create
        -   The first part of the description is used to show different
            credentials in the drop down, so use something
            semi-descriptive
        -   Click \`\`Add\`\`
    -   Credentials will automatically be created in the domain given by
        the \`\`GitHub Server API URL\`\` field.
    -   Select the credentials you just created in the drop down.
    -   The first fifty characters in the Description are used to
        differentiate credentials per job, so again use something
        semi-descriptive
-   Add as many GitHub auth sections as you need, even duplicate server
    URLs

&nbsp;

-   Save to preserve your changes.

#### Creating job:

-   Create a new job.
-   Add the project's GitHub URL to the "GitHub project" field (the one
    you can enter into browser. eg: "https://github.com/janinko/ghprb")
-   Select Git SCM.
-   Add your GitHub "Repository URL".
-   Under Advanced, set "refspec" to

    ``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
    +refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*
    ```

-   In "Branch Specifier", enter

    ``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
    ${sha1}
    ```

    or if you want to use the actual commit in the pull request, use

    ``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
    ${ghprbActualCommit}
    ```

-   Under "Build Triggers", check "Github pull requests builder".
    -   Add admins for this specific job.
    -   If you want to use GitHub hooks for automatic testing, read the
        help for "Use github hooks for build triggering" in job
        configuration. Then you can check the checkbox.
    -   In Advanced, you can modify:
        -   The crontab line for this specific job. This schedules
            polling to GitHub for new changes in Pull Requests.
        -   The whitelisted users for this specific job.
        -   The organisation names whose members are considered
            whitelisted for this specific job.
-   Save to preserve your changes.  
    Make sure you **DON'T** have "Prune remote branches before build"
    advanced option selected, since it will prune the branch created to
    test this build. As noted in issue
    [\#507](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ghprb-plugin/issues/507) this
    may be achieved by unchecking 'Lightweight checkout'.

If you want to manually build the job, in the job setting check "This
build is parameterized" and add string parameter named "sha1". When
starting build give the "sha1" parameter commit id you want to build or
refname (eg: "origin/pr/9/head").

#### Environment Variables

The plugin makes some very useful environment variables available.

-   ghprbActualCommit
-   ghprbActualCommitAuthor
-   ghprbActualCommitAuthorEmail
-   ghprbPullDescription
-   ghprbPullId
-   ghprbPullLink
-   ghprbPullTitle
-   ghprbSourceBranch
-   ghprbTargetBranch
-   ghprbCommentBody
-   sha1

#### Job DSL Support

The plugin contains an extension for the Job DSL plugin to add DSL
syntax for configuring the build trigger and the pull request merger
post-build action.

Here is an example showing all DSL syntax elements:

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
job('example') {
    scm {
        git {
            remote {
                github('test-owner/test-project')
                refspec('+refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*')
            }
            branch('${sha1}')
        }
    }
    triggers {
        githubPullRequest {
            admin('user_1')
            admins(['user_2', 'user_3'])
            userWhitelist('you@you.com')
            userWhitelist(['me@me.com', 'they@they.com'])
            orgWhitelist('my_github_org')
            orgWhitelist(['your_github_org', 'another_org'])
            cron('H/5 * * * *')
            triggerPhrase('OK to test')
            onlyTriggerPhrase()
            useGitHubHooks()
            permitAll()
            autoCloseFailedPullRequests()
            allowMembersOfWhitelistedOrgsAsAdmin()
            extensions {
                commitStatus {
                    context('deploy to staging site')
                    triggeredStatus('starting deployment to staging site...')
                    startedStatus('deploying to staging site...')
                    statusUrl('http://mystatussite.com/prs')
                    completedStatus('SUCCESS', 'All is well')
                    completedStatus('FAILURE', 'Something went wrong. Investigate!')
                    completedStatus('PENDING', 'still in progress...')
                    completedStatus('ERROR', 'Something went really wrong. Investigate!')
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
