This plugin adds Gradle Repo
(<https://github.com/EastWoodYang/Gradle-Repo>) as an SCM provider for
Jenkins. Projects can use this plugin to only run builds when changes
are detected in any of the git repositories in the repo manifest, to
list the changes between builds, and to re-create the project state
across all repositories for any previous build using a static manifest.
