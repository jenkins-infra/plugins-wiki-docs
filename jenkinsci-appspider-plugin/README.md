The Appspider plugin allows you to configure settings to automatically
trigger Appspider scans when builds of your web application completes.
This enables your team to find web security defects earlier in the
software development lifecycle.

## Features

-   Trigger Appspider scan to jenkins post build
-   After a successful scan, the plugin will retrieve the report
    generated by Appspider and store them in the plugin's workspace
-   Plugin is able to create a scan config quickly from the plugin
    without going to the Appspider Enterprise web interface
