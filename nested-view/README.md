View type to allow grouping job views into multiple levels instead of
one big list of tabs.

This plugin adds a new view type that can be selected when adding job
views. This view does not show any jobs, but rather contains another set
of views. By default, clicking on the view tab for a nested view shows a
list of the subviews it contains (with folder icons). You can also
configure a default subview to bypass this intermediate page and jump
directly to that default view. Now the view tabs across the top show the
views in this nested view, and the job list is for this default subview.
This streamlines the navigation between views, but makes it harder to
find the *Edit View* link for the nested view itself. Once a default
subview has been assigned, navigate to the edit page by first clicking
the plus ("+") icon in the view tabs (for adding a new subview) and then
find the *Edit View* link in the sidepanel.

Note, that starting from 1.10 columns Status and Weather are switched
off by default because of issues with performance, but if you'd like to
have them, just edit your view and add respective columns.
