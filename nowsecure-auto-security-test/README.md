## Summary

Purpose-built for mobile app teams, NowSecure AUTO provides fully
automated, mobile appsec testing coverage (static+dynamic+behavioral
tests) optimized for the dev pipeline. Because NowSecure tests the
mobile app binary post-build from Jenkins, it can test software
developed in any language and provides complete results including newly
developed code, 3rd party code, and compiler/operating system
dependencies. With near zero false positives, NowSecure pinpoints real
issues in minutes, with developer fix details, and routes tickets
automatically into ticketing systems, such as Jira. NowSecure is
frequently used to perform security testing in parallel with functional
testing in the dev cycle.
