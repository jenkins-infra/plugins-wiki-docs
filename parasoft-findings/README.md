Since 10.4.2 this plugin has been integrated with the [Warnings Next
Generation
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Warnings+Next+Generation+Plugin) to
visualize static analysis results. Make a copy of all your job
configuration settings prior to upgrading from a previous version of the
Parasoft Findings Plugin for Jenkins. All settings from previous
versions, such as the location of the report.xml files, will be lost
after upgrading. You will need to re-apply your configuration settings
after the upgrade.

# Introduction

The Parasoft Findings Plugin for Jenkins allows you to visualize static
analysis and test results in Jenkins. It converts XML reports generated
by Parasoft products into trend graphs and enables you to conveniently
view the details or easily navigate to rule documentation. The plugin
can be used with Freestyle, Maven, and Pipeline jobs.

The plugin can consume the following report types:

-   Functional test reports generated by Parasoft SOAtest 9.x.
-   Static analysis, metrics analysis, and unit test reports generated
    by 10.x versions of C/C++test, Jtest, and dotTEST.
