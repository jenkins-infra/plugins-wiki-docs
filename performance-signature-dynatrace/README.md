The Performance Signature Plugin collects performance values during a
build and evaluates and compares the result with previous builds and
non-functional requirements. Several software tests can be run and
evaluated automatically, so that the most important key performance
indicators (KPI) can be summarized and be available for all project
participants very quickly.
