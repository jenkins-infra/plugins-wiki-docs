Allows users to be logged in to Jenkins automatically when they are
logged into another site.

## Features

-   Seamless login to Jenkins when logged into the main site
    -   Single Sign On
    -   Empowers admins to easily make their own authentication backend
    -   Makes it possible to use the same account across all sites owned
        by the same domain

## Requirements

### Jenkins

Jenkins [version 1.625.3](https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/#v1.625.3)
or newer is required.

## How it works

1\. This plugin authenticates users via a shared identifying cookie. This
is likely to be a session ID (e.g. PHPSESSID) which is shared between
the Target URL's domain and Jenkins' domain.  
2. The identifying cookie must be shared between the two sites. This is
possible for subdomains by setting a cookie's domain to .domain.com
(note the leading dot).  
3. When a user requests a Jenkins page, their Cookie header is sent to
the configurable Target URL as a GET request, which authenticates the
user and sends back a JSON response with the user\_name, display\_name
and public\_email with status 200 OK. All JSON keys are configurable.  
4. If the server at the Target URL cannot authenticate the user with the
sent cookies, it will respond with error code 401 Unauthorized. If you
want to see this in action, try [my
version](https://pgmann.cf/sso/data).  
5. The user will be authenticated in Jenkins if possible. Their
username, display name and email will be set using the data from the
JSON request.  
6. If the user cannot be authenticated, they will be able to click
'Login' at the top right as normal to be taken to the specified external
\`Login URL\` which will log the user into the SSO service. When the
user returns a fresh check will be made to check if the user has just
logged in.

Because authentication takes place via cookie, this plugin is designed
for sites where the user is already logged into a trusted, parent site.
It would be a security risk to share sensitive cookies with third party
sites.

### Setup Guide

You can find a ready-made example backend server in the [sso
folder](https://github.com/jenkinsci/url-auth-sso-plugin/blob/master/sso),
written with PHP and using GitHub OAuth to facilitate SSO. There are a
few simple steps to get this example working on your own server.

1\. Drag the sso folder into the Document Root of your webserver.  
2. Open the sso/signin.php file and set your Client ID and Client Secret
[from GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers). Also set the User
Agent header to match your own website address (and purpose).  
3. Set your session cookie, PHPSESSID, to be shared across subdomains of
your domain. This can be accomplished by setting session.cookie\_domain
= ".example.com" in your php.ini. If you're using Apache on Linux, this
is likely to be located at /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini.  
4. Install url-auth-sso-plugin on your Jenkins server. Go to Configure
Global Security and change the Security Realm to URL Auth Plugin. Set
the Target URL to the path to your data.php file - for example,
<http://example.com/sso/data.php>. Also set the Login URL to the path to
your signin.php file - for example,
<http://example.com/sso/signin.php>.  
5. (Optional) Change the signin.php file to meet your own needs. There
are no limits to what you can do, so long as you set at least
$\_SESSION\["user\_name"\] as I have in the example script.
